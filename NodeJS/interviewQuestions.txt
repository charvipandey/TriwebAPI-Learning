-purpose of package.json
=package.json is the configuration file for the project:
includes metadata (project name, version, dependencies, scripts, configurations)
helps manage dependencies and scripts efficiently

-working of event loop
=event loop in node js is single-threaded:
handles asynchronous operations, checks event queue, processes callbacks,
executes non-blocking io operations, schedules callbacks once operations complete

-error handling
=using try-catch for synchronous code,
error-first callbacks or promises (.catch()) for asynchronous code,
async/await with try-catch for handling errors in async functions

-middleware in express.js
=a function in express js:
executes during request lifecycle, can modify request/response objects,
end request-response cycle, call next middleware,
used for tasks like logging, authentication, parsing request bodies

-obj destructuting
=a syntax in javaScript:
allows unpacking values from objects into distinct variables,
simplifies code and makes it more readable

-sync vs async
=sync operations block the execution thread until completed,
async operations allow other tasks to run while waiting, enhancing performance and responsiveness

-obj to str
=convert object to string using JSON.stringify():
serializes object to json string, useful for storing or transmitting data
